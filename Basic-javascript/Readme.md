# Data types in Javascript 

In JavaScript, data types specify the type of data that can be stored and manipulated within a program. JavaScript has several built-in data types, which are generally divided into two categories: primitive and non-primitive (or reference types).

# Primitive Data Types:

- Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers. Example: 42, 3.14.
- String: Represents sequences of characters. Example: "hello", 'world'.
- Boolean: Represents logical values — either true or false.
- Undefined: Indicates a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value. Example: let x; // x is undefined.
- Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value. Example: let y = null;.
- Symbol: Introduced in ES6, it’s a unique and immutable data type, often used for object property keys. Example: let sym = Symbol('description');.
- BigInt: Introduced in ES2020, it’s used to represent numbers larger than the Number type can safely handle. Example: let bigIntNum = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;

# Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types:

- Object: A complex data type that allows you to store collections of data

- Array: A special type of object for storing ordered collections

- Function: A special type of object that is .
